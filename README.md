CryptoClustering

For this challenge, we looked at the prices and changes of prices for popular cryptocurrencies. 

I was able to use my previous class lessons to perform the analysis needed on the data, as well as getting some assistance from Xpert Learning Assistant as well as ChatGPT. 

Included in this repository are the finished Jupyter Notebook, the CSV file, and Jupyter checkpoints. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my challenge.
